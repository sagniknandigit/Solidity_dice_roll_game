# Simple Dice Roll Game On-Chain

## Project Title
Simple Dice Roll Game On-Chain

## Project Description
This project is an on-chain dice roll game built using Solidity. Players can place bets and roll a virtual dice. If they roll a number greater than a threshold, they win and receive a reward. The game ensures fairness by utilizing blockchain-based randomness and smart contract transparency.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a fully decentralized, provably fair, and transparent dice game on the blockchain. By eliminating intermediaries, players can enjoy a trustless gaming experience where outcomes are determined purely by smart contract logic.

## Future Scope
- Integration with Chainlink VRF for enhanced randomness.
- Support for multiple dice roll variations and different betting strategies.
- A front-end interface for user-friendly interaction.
- Multi-token support for betting in different cryptocurrencies.
- Expansion to Layer-2 networks for lower gas fees and faster transactions.

## Key Features
- Fully on-chain, decentralized dice roll game.
- Transparent and immutable smart contract logic.
- Players place bets and receive payouts based on dice roll outcomes.
- Smart contract ensures fairness using blockchain-generated randomness.
- Secure fund management with owner-controlled deposits and withdrawals.
